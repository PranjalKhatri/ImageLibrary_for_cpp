This is a cpp library for working with images
Additional features will be added as the project progresses like support for multiple image types, videos, compressing, manipulating etc..
This doesn't use lib jpeg or other libraries, 
I recommend using stb[https://github.com/nothings/stb] library for that, and the purpose of this library is to give an idea of how can someone work with image files without external libraries
